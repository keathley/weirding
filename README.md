# Weirding

<!-- MDOC !-->

Weirding offers the best in class solution for generating tons of absurd text
for your elixir project.

```elixir
iex> Weirding.words()
=> "Holograms twisted her eyes. An uncomfortable stirring sounded genuinely
happy. Case put aside to the lift of the blasphemy pouring her call it. Yueh
stiffened, whirled away \"I didnâ€™t remember it safe distance. And to a watch
these garments\" the man shrugged."
```

## Why?

Why not?

## Why is compilation slow?

In order to provide the maximum runtime performance Weirding does a lot of
optimizing at compile time. This results in some additional compile time.

## Should I use this in production?

I don't know why you would but I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:weirding, "~> 0.2"},
  ]
end
```
